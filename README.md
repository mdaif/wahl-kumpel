# Wahlkumpel

A chat buddy that answers questions on the German elections Feb 2025 based on the PDF
manifestos of each party of the main parties (AFD, BSW, CDU/CSU, Die Linke, FDP, Die Gruenen,
and SPD.

The app supports both the English and German languages.

The suggested questions are generated by the agent and could be used to ask the app
for more information.

# Motive 
Since most of the leading parties wrote their electoral programs in PDF format, and
in the German language, and since I (and probably others) speak German only on the B1
level, which isn't enough to follow through hundreds of pages written in advanced
German, I thought that'd be a nice way to break into the world of German politics :-)

I also wanted to play around with Langchain and see what the hype is about :-)

# Expectations

The first iteration should be able to consume all the PDF files that detail the election
plan for each major party and answer the most burning questions.

# How to run locally
This agent uses OpenAI's API, which isn't free, unfortunately.
If you feel like trying the app locally, you can create an API key
https://openai.com/index/openai-api/
and then export an env variable
```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
```

You can then run either the dockerized version
```shell
docker-compose build wahlkumpel
docker-compose up --no-start wahlkumpel
docker-compose start wahlkumpel
```

or running the app using `uv`
```shell
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# create venv
uv venv

# install requirements
uv sync

# run the app
uv run fastapi dev src/me/daif/main.py
```
