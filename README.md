# Wahlkumpel

A chat buddy that answers questions on the German elections Feb 2025.

# Motive 
Since most of the leading parties wrote their electoral programs in PDF format, and
in the German language, and since I (and probably others) speak German only on the B1
level, which isn't enough to follow through hundreds of pages written in advanced
German, I thought that'd be a nice way to break into the world of German politics :-)

I also wanted to play around with Langchain and see what the type is about :-)

# Expectations

The first iteration should be able to consume all the PDF files that detail the election
plan for each major party and answer the most burning questions.

The specifics will follow.
